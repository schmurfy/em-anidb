<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="221885">It starts out strong, with unique ideas &amp; a good combination of action, drama, comedy and feelings. One of the cutest females ever, too. However, instead of building on it`s strong foundations, it`s losing its grip halfway through and, along fast forwards, it`s feeling more and more trivial. The plot is also rapidly changing from dramatic to petty and insignificant. I got the feeling they were suddenly experimenting with new stuff, or unsure of how to continue with their setting.
Real shame, could`ve been truly great.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="479958">One of the best anime ever seen 
A well done combination of action and romance , but  in my opinion what really stood out were the feelings and the reality of it
I wish I could go to SAO xPPP</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="23892">A must see!!! ^_^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="241461">This is the best anime of the year, and I have seen moste of them. I strongly recommend this anime. if u compare it to another anime I woud say that hunter x hunter greed island is some what close to this in genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="53032">1st arc: VASTLY overrated, but still quite good. Despite some nagging plot holes and Mary Sue/Gary Stu moments (especially towards the end of the arc), it`s still easily better than the mediocrity that is its sibling "Accel World".

2nd arc: Pretty much throws away any pretence of actually being set within a real game, recycling the same old cliches you`ve seen in countless shonen series whilst barely attempting to cover them with MMO veneer, repeatedly requires both characters and viewers to be wilfully blind to ignore blatant contrivances and plot holes, down to even an 11th hour literal deus ex machina victory against an utterly one-dimensional antagonist.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="231802">Episode 1 just released.
From the way it is, it is a must for fans of MMORPG. It will remind you everything about your MMORPG days... spawning, partying, ganking, classes, treasure chest, monster hunt...

Hope it stays with the pace and true to MMORPG concept.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="1083">As usual the changes made compared to the genial light novels made this anime adaptation an average fantasy.
Superfluous additional female characters (all of them cute of course) right at the start made this almost a harem anime. This is totally the opposed to the novels. And also goes against the reality of MMO-s what was an important factor that made this story unique.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="146198">bit slow to start but gets better towards the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="445355">Entertaining action-packed MMO Story that will appeal to MMO lovers and players, but overall theme and plot of racing for your life just seems to be blissfully ignored.   Feels like they are just wanting to write a straight MMO story but were forced to adapt an established property.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="232559">Only for fans of MMORPGs and those who waste their times with them.

It`s pretty much the teen nerd`s ultimate wet dream: playing videogames with hot chicks who will have the hots for you (and wanting sex with you)vand being "badass", whereas they aren`t IRL.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="88664">If the first episode of this anime is any indication this will be a fantastic series. I`m hoping it may even trump Druaga itself.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="273035">If this is Solo Playing, they dont know what is forever alone/nerd/ or true game. For fans only, he change mind more often than women shoes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="378121">Well i know most mmorpg fans are getting tired of the usual system and want to try out this awesome future virtual reality so that`s why its popular. So mmorpg fans are the ones that will really appreciate this kind of an anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="132520">first half was great but ended in a complete MEH kind of fashion. second half was a complete failure.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="531127">A good anime with a great start, nice characters, fights and interesting story about MMO , but I`m a little disagree with the end and all after first half. It could have been a best anime. For me 7/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="382602">Interesting premise, but quite bad execution and full of directional and logical mistakes. The animation team clearly don`t have enough video game knowledge to make a title like SAO. And in the first place, the original novel was mediocre by itself, the characters were simple and flat, and the plot nothing special.
Why watch it then? For fans of .hack//, I guess?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="338163">Fans of MMORPG games will get the most out of this. Reminds me of playing UO when nobody knew how to play. MMO was a new thing, as with the VR in this. Good story, setting, and characters so far.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="420432">i watched it and liked it... so calm and amazin series. plot is really koool and thank god there are no boring characters in this anime. just watch it its one of the best of this year same as kuroko no basket.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="173070">This series seems somewhat innocent and lighthearted at times, but it truly draws out the darkest sides of human nature.

There were times when this series was heart-warming and humorous, and then times that made me sick to my stomach with disgust. Simply put, it elicited certain responses very well.

Aside from that, there`s a great element of romance in it, one that doesn`t move god-awful slow but actually MOVES. On top of that, it has some good action, and real character development. You`ll see the characters change right before your eyes, in many ways.

Very worth watching, but be prepared to want to stab a few of the characters in the throat. Enjoy.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="581152">Great animation, lovable characters and a main character who knows he`s strong(he doesn`t discover it by winning battles barely alive). About the ending, well... in my opinion it`s the beginning. The VRMMO`s are shown as a corruption unlike any other. At the end after all they had to endure they still go back, in other words once in you can never click the "log out" button.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="185992">This anime is enthralling from the start and abruptly loses its momentum mid way than gradually becomes less interesting until the finish line. The pace of this anime is fast which makes for some interesting developments and keeps the show intense. It however causes a setback in the manner where characters and the world dont get as flushed out as well as it could have been. While the latter of the anime was okay it just doesnt reach the quality of attention that the former possessed. There is also a shift of focus and emphasis in the story which could turn away some; transitioning from a survival adventure to heavy doses of romance and drama left and right and continues to expand on those points until the very end. The ending in some ways brought good closure and compensated a little bit for the lackluster second half. If this series only expanded and emphasized the shows strong points it just could have possibly reached greatness.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="576556">This anime is one of my favorites .It has very good plot , cool main characters and some romance .I would be happy to watch it again so i think every fan of the genre will like it too :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="547692">In the first episode it displays a good concept for a new anime this season. I anticipate a great story. I would recommend to anyone to watch this anime this season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="579724">Its a pretty good anime overall well at least the first half is, I was actually pretty damn impressed with the first half I loved it for a matter of fact but then things started to get weird after episode 14 they should have just ended it there and then with 3~2 extra aftermath episodes that would have been perfect in my opinion.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="373896">I was actually well surprised during the first episode. I`ve never seen an anime with a plot like that. I didn`t like the personality change of Asuna, that really kinda seemed like a fanservice, but other than that, I really liked the series. Though I didn`t get attached to the characters all that much. I do think it`s worth trying.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="330647">This was a pretty good series with excellent action and enjoyable humour and character development. Granted, if you are familiar with MMORPGs you will find certain parts even better. Both halves of the series were good, though there is a very noticeable change between the two that not everyone might enjoy.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="248649">Incredibly the best anime of this season. It starts really good with a promising and original story and step by step loses its intensity toward the beginning of the second arc. In any case a good watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="545305">The first half (SAO arc) started very well and had the potential to turn into a masterpiece. It was nice combination of Action, Fantasy, Romance and Tragedy. Although some little things were left out from the original LN but it was very good. However it became rather cliche and boring in the second half (ALO arc). The ending wasn`t all that interesting too. I enjoyed this anime since the first half was done so good and recommend it to MMORPG fans, you`ll probably enjoy it a lot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="468231">First season 9/10
Seacond season 4/10
Wish they used all 25 episodes for the first season and removed the last season.
The series would most likely have been much better that way.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="286723">Read the light novel. Was brilliant. The anime looks like it`s gearing up to that aspect as well. If you like good stories, give this a try. Recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="10227">I was a little sceptical at first because .hack//SIGN sucked. But this one is really cool - no boring main character and confusing plot. It`s all pretty obvious but still engaging. Great animation and music, loveable characters and a decent plot. Enough action and some emotional and deep moments.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="210547">I really recommended, people who play "mmo" game will love it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="337065">1st episode shows amaizing potential in this anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97537">Like watching WoW without the game pad...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="69845">The battle animations make up for every negative comment you could think for this show. If you still think this is a waste of your time, watch the OP/ED and skip the rest also works.  Enough said.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="186852">SAO was surprisingly good. For one such as me who do not particularly enjoy MMOs this had a crucial plot component which made it much more interesting. Unfortunately the plot took a turn for the worse around episode 14, which dragged it down considerably. To be honest they could have stopped at episode 14, it`s almost like two separate series. 1-14 was amazing, and worth every second, quite possibly the best I have seen in a long time. It`s astounding how close you grew to the characters in such a short time, it was masterful of them to squeeze all that into 14 episodes. Just a pity they didn`t save much for the rest of the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="522616">Well... I can say that I was a little skeptical about this one when I began to watch it... what a good surprise! First of all, this is a fast passed anime, and thats like GOLD lately, 10 ep and some well developed romance + 4 eps more story development. Maybe I`m just sick of those 12-24 ep animes that are SOOOO slow and with a obviously "kinda" gay and shy main character. Kirito is just... cool. This one is very interesting. Plus, don`t buy that "MMORPG fan" crap...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="425228">I`ll probably be repeating the same thing others have said, but this anime is incredible and amazing. Even if you don`t like MMORPGs, you should still watch this. I mean, it is that good! I have not bought any anime in a while, but I will definitely be purchasing this series when it comes out on DVD/Blu-ray. Just watch it; you won`t be disappointed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="297053">Definitely a must see. You can not believe how good this is!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="529895">One of the best anime I`ve seen so far. I love the setting, great characters and epic action. Good pace as well. Kinda hard not to go peek ahead in the novels though cause the story is very compelling.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="342700">I didn`t watch such awesome and addictive watch for over a year! Anime is good for me when during watching first episodes, I feel bad that it`s so short and it will eventually end. Had that feeling only with best masterpieces of anime world, and this one gave me while full enjoyment that feeling too :p I didn`t read manga, but I felt like a lot of mini plots were removed. Shame!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="536061">An excellent series, marred by a sub-par second arc. Fascinating and believable setting with lovable characters including a strong female co-star who doesn`t feel like she exists solely as the main character`s victory prize. Unfortunately, the second arc while still pretty good is nowhere near as excellent as the first for multiple reasons. For me, it`s biggest sin though is that it undoes a lot of what makes several characters interesting in the first arc. Those familiar with the series origin know that original story as it was first conceived was intended to end at the conclusion of the first arc, and it very definitely shows.

Still. Highly recommend watching. Despite my dislike of the second arc, the series very quickly ended up in my personal top 5. This is the series you wanted to be watching during .hack

Fair warning, SERIOUS sexual assault trigger warnings involved here.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="413731">if you liked the .Hack game/anime series this is a must watch show, I loved it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="172977">Up untill midway its probably one of the best anime i have ever seen. There was no reason at all for that sudden change, it could have been a masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="495005">Those of you Gamers that have ever dreamed about being stuck in an actual MMORPG then this show is a must. And those of you who want a good show to watch, then you picked a good one. Though the love story is kinda sporadic, the gameplay and the logic is accurate. You will cry, you will laugh and you will rage while watching this show. This is definitely a show to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="527292">For all those who recommended this as a must see i applaud u all it is truely amazing and cant wait for more... best anime ive seen this year.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="491381">want action? or romance? or fantasy? it`s all in one . must see for almost everyone :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="492628">Epic, strange start but after that, epic.
The early episodes some things fell too rushed and others seam to drag too long. The author tryed to explain almost all the rules of the world in the early episodes.
After that it is pure epicness, once Asuna returns to the story, it never gets dull and it just gets better and better.
Must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="487479">Great anime, in every aspect from music to animation. It just sucks that there is so little they could do with the story. I felt it had so much more potential with the world than what they did. The ending was meh as well but it is still a must watch, albeit overrated a bit. Still can`t wait for any OVAs or a second season, definitely one of my favorites in a while.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="573698">Why was asuna not in the ending there when they were all going to the tower again....wtf is that shit? Great anime cleaned it out in 2 days but why show a dedicated relationship in the real world and then question it in the sense that he was there with his sister and asuna no where to be found..Few questions left in the anime, great concept 9/10 :)!! If they ended this anime on episode 14 or created a new aspect of the first dive 10/10. Still a must see for action/romance. Focuses heavily on both aspects which is VERY hard to find normally heavy action light romance or vice versa. Very balanced must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="170461">Just amazing</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="82377">Have to say this is one amazing series. It starts off as yet another .hack// copy / generic fantasy, but quickly builds up into an epic that pulls you in completely. There`s joy, sadness, relief, anger, pure excitement, all bundled into those 25 episodes, intertwining and mixing seamlessly. A tiny spoiler here, the show goes through 3 "phases" that break up any monotony you`d expect from such a long series and each offer a different experience.

A good casual watch, but immerse yourself in the world and it becomes a truly wonderful journey.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="242627">No doubt, this series has become one of my all-time favourites. The premise may be hard to swallow because of it`s fictitious nature and some basic plot-holes, but once you get past that... you`ll quickly find yourself sunken in it`s deep, rich storyline. Only warning - you should understand basic MMORPG mechanics to fully involve with the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="565188">this anime make me want to play MMORPG again.
a must see especially for MMORPG gamer and don`t forget to read the LN version for detail explanation about the anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="209509">A truly incredible anime, characters and story are wonderful. Definitely worth watching!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="226356">Great series all around, some directional differences compared to the Light Novels though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="423685">An excellent fantasy with with (MMO)RPG elements that will not irk the real players w/ their presentation. There are some pretty hardcore moments, unexpectedly, so its not kiddy stuff either. Balanced in both story and production value and "angst"-y enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Wonderful conclusion w/ no loose ends. An anime, well-deserving of praise and a deffinite must-watch for fans of fantasy romances.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="566906">Flawless cast, and an inspiring history!
One of the best animes I`ve ever seen!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="447833">I felt like this anime was taken straight from my daydreaming of what if? I`m reminded so much of times playing MMO`s. The anime has great art, the characters arent shallow, and show promise for future development. This is a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="549561">superb</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="461432">One of the most beautiful, moving and best anime that i have ever seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="315386">At first, I thought this anime was just another .Hack sign copy but then later proves this anime is really different from .hack which that anime totally sucked.
It`s must watch for all MMORPG players and even if you don`t like or play much of them, it has romance and loneliness and tragedy..etc with good storyline. Plus the Awesome opening and ending songs. I like how they didn`t completely focus in game like .hack did, it really truly a good MMORPG anime. Main character, side characters to me all of them are good. Also liked the fact that this series original work was a Light Novel.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="468958">One of the BEST.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="233579">One of my favorite novels got a good adaptation. There are some flaws (especially some cuts in episodes adapted from side stories), but I still think that this is the best series in the season.
PS: Sorry for bad English ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="306187">one of my favorite animes ever !! great animation , great story , great romance , great action , everything is great ...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="287128">It show really indepth about MMO, it is compulsory watch for MMO gamer. It show about dream of a VR MMO. It esp 1 show great storyline. there is no rush in the esp. great animation art.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="4913">Yep. This is "overrated". There are many shortcuts and shortcomings. It`s too fast for a story. It has simplicities.

But. When I watched it, I started an ep. And then I thought "What?! Has it ended already?!". 20 minutes flew like 5 or 10 while watching this.

Light, thrilling, and interesting to the end. Even if it has many oddities here and there, it`s a "must watch".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="159558">Haven`t see a great Anime like this in years.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="332307">I don`t like MMORPG but i like the anime. It`s somehow mature stuff. Love, lonelines, friendship, action, heart break... All you need is in one. Definetely a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291819">After the first episode I went and read all the novels.  I can tell you so far the show has followed them almost word for word.  Only exceptions are to cut down some thing for time constrants which is understandable.

The books were brilliant and I loved them, the show is just as good.  Its got a great concept and the characters show real impact after events.  People are worried about the side stories but if you read the books there is purpose for them at later times.

Its not useless fluff fillers like a lot of bleach and naruto that have no bearing on the main story.  Give this anime a try, if you like it read the books.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="303812">Just one word to describe this : Awesome!!! In every aspect of the anime. I really love this anime. ^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="443072">Great anime the atmosphere is awesome ,allaways refering to skills and stats brings the nerd out of me and the story is solid too. Plus the main carater reminds me my first mmo, wondering about helping noobs in a way under lvl area :D
I Love it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="31168">I love the character progression of both the main characters. It does feel a bit rushed with the introduction of new characters to only see them disappear in the next episode, but the events do eventually tie in to the protagonist`s character. Plus, it doesn`t feel like it affects the overall quality of the series unlike other series`.

The friendship love story is touching especially in the context of MMORPGs. Definitely looking forward to watching the next episode!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="530122">The best 2012 anime, and a masterpiece. As simple as that.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="139011">A little weak in places but over all a very enjoyable piece of entertainment. Easily went into my top 20 list</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="151823">It`s one of the best in this year... and one of the best ever in this genre</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="434072">One of the best anime for this year.., strongly recommended.. especially for MMORPG lovers..!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="99271">This is one of the best animes I have seen. I`m sure that not just gamers but also people who don`t game can enjoy this! The characters are great, and the visuals are awesome. I wish it would be a bit longer though, it`s one of those animes you never want to end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="238891">The first half of the anime is really great. It got me hooked quite quickly and it is something different from the regular RPG anime. 
However, I wish I stopped watching after that first half, because in the second half it became rubbish. There is a strong focus on sexual harrassment which was completely unecessary. It went to an extent that I felt was way too extreme to just be part of telling the story. It really ruined it for me. So if don`t like things like that, I would advise you to stop after episode 14 and maybe watch the last episode.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="33154">If they follow the light novels and put it back in chronological order (witch I think they will) then this would be one of the best show of the season as I can`t stop reading the novel already, I can`t wait to see it all in anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="239740">Best anime of the year. Just watch it already! Way better than Accel world.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="411316">Not sure what else there is to say than what has already been said, so I`ll just repeat it :D!
The story is great, it`s fast paced but doesn`t rush anything, which is rare in itself. There`s a great deal of character development, which I think is why the protagonist is one of my favorite characters, the world changes him bit by bit, but the change isn`t "out of his character", it`s more a case of him maturing a great deal.
 The animation quality, voice acting, etc. is great as well!
I`m adding this to my list of all-time favorites!

Even if you aren`t all that interested in MMORPG`s, this is still an anime you can enjoy immensely, because the plot doesn`t focus on the fact that it`s an MMORPG more than necessary, so other than the first episode it`s more of a fantasy story.
That being said, if you are familiar with MMORPG`s like myself, you`re going to enjoy it even more ;).

In short, give it a try, you won`t regret it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="75448">This is THE anime of 2012, good animation, story based on light novels (books), also highly recommended to read them as well, anime will have new feeling then</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="356572">The story lingers in my mind, even several days after having completely watched the series. Seldom that this happens to me. I hope a second series comes out.
It`s a pity that they obviously sped up the story in the anime, about halfway the series, compared to the manga, which I haven`t read (yet).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="369649">No doubt one of the best shows of 2012, with good characters and storyline. Of course, a lot of detail from the original LNs are missing, but in all, this show is being well executed. I look forward to this every week!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="303237">Give it try , you wont regret it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="509497">wow!
read all the novels too
this series complements them beautifully
amazing</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="387581">This anime is one of the best out there , and more than that it has an good story and an virtual interface.
Its a must see!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="493280">Started watching this anime when the series was at epsiode 8 due to all the hype and hate that surrounded it I was curious and wanted to check it for my self. In the end I watched all available episodes at one go till 3am in the morning and when finished I read the Light Novel, it was an epic story from start to finish that deserve all the attention of the thousands of fans and haters. (great anime always have haters do not be put off by them)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="331999">Sword Art Online is such an amazing light novel that I have read. When I first read it I spent about 16 hours straight reading it. And to be able to watch this light novel that struck my being with such a brutal force in an animation, was truly incredible and satisfying. Even though it felt a little rushed through the arcs and some scenes were skipped I`m sorry to say that I`m given this a 10 and Must See.

Thank you for animating this wonderful piece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="177640">FIRST: THIS IS NOT HAREM! People who say that can`t tell what is harem or not.

Here we have a virtual, RPG like, world much more believable than any other anime that dealt with the theme before. This story is about character development and romance mainly, back off if you want to see amazing apotheotic fights 80% of the time, although there are some cool but short fights to see. Love is the fuel and it`s better developed and fulfilling that any shoujo I have seen recently. SAO is the best anime of the year and it`s better than the light novel it comes from.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="538195">F*cking awesome!.. Hurry up and watch dont just read this text of mine! ........................................And your still here... *facepalm*</recommendation>

<name>Future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.&#13;
&#13;
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>Thriller</name>
<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control. (Source: Wikipedia)</description>

<category id="285" parentid="153" hentai="false" weight="100">
<name>Violent Retribution for Accidental Infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).&#13;
&#13;
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>Breast Fondling</name>
<description>Part of the slapstick comedy in ecchi anime between female characters. E.g. a girl envious of another girl`s bust size may tease the latter via fondling. Usually playful and mischievous, not sexual.

Alas, now the tag can also imply "boob grabbing", where a male character will either accidentally or intentionally touch the breasts of a female. The former is a comedy element, as in "accidental infringement", the latter can be interpreted as a form of harassment.</description>

<name>Calling Your Attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"

Having a special attack is always a must but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.

It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.

A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.</description>

*synonymous jaws dropping*
This anime`s main character is comparable to the gods themselves in terms of resistibility, strength and/or downright bad-assery. Whenever they seem as if the fire inside has burnt out, they rise from the ashes with enough tenacity and ferocity to vanquish any foe that dare stand against them.</description>

<description>The main protagonist of the series. He is the protagonist and is a "solo" player, a player who hasn`t joined a guild and usually works alone. When it is announced that the players of Sword Art Online can no longer logout, he is surprised like everyone else, but unlike everyone else he quickly gets over it and accepts it, to an extent. He mainly uses a one-handed sword and usually wears all black in game, as it adds to stealth. He can also use two blades at once, a unique skill to him and he only uses it in emergencies to avoid attention for being one out of the two people to have unique skills. His game alias is Kirito, which is created by taking the syllables of the first and last Kanji of his real last and first names respectively: (Kirigaya Kazuto). In the real world, he lives with his mother and younger sister in a family of 3.</description>
